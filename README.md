# Panetrie

_"panetrie" - Anglo-French term meaning pantry (bread room)._

Config driven ALPM hook to synchronize Pacman and AUR installed package lists to a local directory.

Inspired by [pug](https://github.com/Ventto/pug) and [aptl](https://github.com/pegromdev/aptl).

Documentation available [here](./docs/docs.md).

## Requirements

-   pacman - package manager utility

## Installation

```
$ yay -S panetrie
```

## Goal

There are a myriad of package list generator alpm hooks out there, so how is this different?

The main aim of this project is to give you the power to tweak where and how these package lists and their versions are generated. It's super handy for those of us who use dotfile sync scripts every day. The idea is pretty simple: your dotfile setup should keep pace with your package versions. I couldn't find anything out there that quite suites my needs so, I thought, why not make it myself? hoping it makes your life a bit easier too.
